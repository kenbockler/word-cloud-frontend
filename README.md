# Word Cloud Frontend

The Word Cloud Frontend is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to upload a text file (up to 100 MB) and generate a word cloud based on it. Users can also view the list of words with their frequencies and check the processing status (pending, in progress, completed).

This part of the project is built using the React framework and deployed using Vite.

## Features

- Users can upload a text file (up to 100 MB)
- Users can view a JSON-formatted list of words with their frequencies
- Users can generate a word cloud image
- Users can check the processing status (pending, in progress, completed)
